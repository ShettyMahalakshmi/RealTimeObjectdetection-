# Real-Time-Object-Detection-using-OpenCV-and-Deep-Learning
- Implemented using Python3, OpenCV 3.x, MobileNets and SSD(Single Shot MultiBox Detector) trained on Caffe Model. 
- Run this command in cmd : python real_time_object_detection.py --prototxt MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt --model MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel

As part of Opencv 3.4.+ deep neural network(dnn) module was included officially. The dnn module allows load pre-trained models from most populars deep learning frameworks, including Tensorflow, Caffe, Darknet, Torch. Besides MobileNet-SDD other architectures are compatible with OpenCV 3.4.1 :

    GoogleLeNet
    YOLO
    SqueezeNet
    Faster R-CNN
    ResNet
